Russian Roulette - Notes

1. create a function that returns the number of players playing - this will be called 'character count'

2. create a gun selection function (it wont contribue anything to the game, but its justs for vanity)

3. create a 'storyline' function - add in different times (day, night), locations (house, bar). it should include how many people are playing, using function number 1.

(add in two for each for simplicity at the start)

4. create the game function

	i. use randint to generate a number from 1-6. this number will be saved to the variable 'bullet'

	ii. iterate through all the characters playing, by taking in the number player, like player 1, player 2, player 3, player 4 etc.

	iii. the player will 'spin the revolver and fire'. randint will come into effect, from 1 to 6. if the number is equal to bullet, the character is dead

		a. if the character dies, decrement 1 from the character count.

		b. say that the character is dead.
	
	
	else if the character is not dead, say that the gun didnt kill him/her, then move to the next character
